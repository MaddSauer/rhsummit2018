== Mastering Serverless PaaS with OpenShift - Lab Guide

:numbered:
== Overview

This Lab Environment uses OpenShift 3.9, and Apache OpenWhisk, as open source Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) implementation for Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions on either Private, Hybrid and Public Clouds.

Apache OpenWhisk is designed to act as an asynchronous and loosely coupled execution environment that can run functions against external triggers. 
 
The initial configuration steps include:

* Configuring the access to OpenShift Container Platform Console and Web Console
* Accessing and managing Function-as-a-Service (faas) project inside OCP
* Configure OpenWhisk CLI to access faas project

After this initial step, we will try out main object of OpenWhisk such

* Actions
* Rules
* Triggers

In particular, we will do a step by step procedure to create and run functions as *Java Actions*, *Node Actions*, *Python Actions*


.Goal
* Create Functions and consume them at scale with OpenShift Container Platform

=== OpenShift requirements

OpenShift Container Platform is the product built from the code of its upstream project Origin. 

Initially OpenShift will be deployed using the following appliance:
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/welcome/index.html[OpenShift 3.9.14]

To save time a pre-deployed appliance is provided of 4 Nodes, 1 Master and 3 App nodes

=== OpenWhisk requirements

OpenWhisk will run as containerized inside OpenShift, from official image on Docker Hub, properly tagged for OCP (rhdemo-b7724ef)
